# Lending Club Case Study
This is a case study on Lending Club data analysis, done as part of an EDA assignment for Executive PG Programme in Machine Learning & AI - February 2023 course.



## Introduction
In this case study, we explore the Lending Club dataset, which contains loan data for different borrowers. The aim of this analysis is to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default and provide insights that can help inform business decisions.

## Approach
We used Python and its data analysis libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Lending Club dataset. The EDA process involved data cleaning and manipulation, data analysis and visualization.


## Conclusions
We found some interesting things during our analysis, such as:
- People who have taken loan for a tenure of 60 months have higher chances of defaulting
- Borrowers with public bankruptcy records (1 & 2) are more likely to default on their loans.
- People with High and Very High Income with Homeownership(other) tend to default on Loan
